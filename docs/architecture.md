## Architecture Overview

The high‑level architecture of this end‑to‑end data engineering solution combines infrastructure provisioning, container orchestration and data‑pipeline logic on Google Cloud Platform.  The design prioritises scalability, resilience and compliance with European data‑protection regulations.

### Components

| Component | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **Terraform** | Defines and provisions all cloud resources: GKE cluster, Pub/Sub topic & subscription, BigQuery dataset/table, IAM roles and networking. |
| **Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE)** | Hosts the Python microservice that consumes messages from Pub/Sub, pseudonymises sensitive fields and writes to BigQuery.  Each pod runs a container built from the `data_pipeline.py` service. |
| **Pub/Sub** | Serves as the ingestion layer for raw transaction events.  Messages are published by the upstream application and consumed by the worker service. |
| **BigQuery** | Stores cleansed and pseudonymised data.  Tables are partitioned by ingestion date to improve query performance and support retention policies. |
| **Secret Manager** | Securely stores pseudonymisation salts, database URIs and other secrets. |
| **Cloud Storage** | Lands optional raw event archives and batch files with lifecycle retention and CMEK encryption. |
| **Cloud Dataflow** | Optional managed streaming/batch enrichment path for higher-volume workloads before BigQuery. |
| **Cloud DLP** | Inspects sample or production payloads for common PII patterns before curated analytics storage. |
| **Cloud KMS** | Provides customer-managed encryption keys for Pub/Sub, BigQuery and Cloud Storage. |
| **Artifact Registry** | Stores the worker container image used by GKE deployments. |
| **Dataplex / Data Catalog** | Adds governance, discovery and metadata management across curated BigQuery and raw GCS zones. |
| **Cloud Scheduler / Cloud Run** | Supports scheduled public-data loaders and lightweight API ingestion endpoints that publish to Pub/Sub. |
| **Cloud Logging, Monitoring, Error Reporting, Trace & Audit Logs** | Provides observability into pipeline health, throughput, latency and errors. Logs are audited to satisfy GDPR accountability requirements. |

### Data Flow

1. **Event Publishing:** Retail, mobility, ESG, Cloud Run loader or Cloud Scheduler-triggered jobs publish JSON events to the Pub/Sub topic and may land raw batch files in Cloud Storage.
2. **Message Consumption:** The Python microservice running on GKE subscribes to the topic and pulls messages in real time.
3. **Pseudonymisation & Processing:** The service applies a SHA‑256 hash to the user ID, removes unnecessary fields (data minimisation) and adds an ingestion timestamp. Additional transformations (e.g., currency conversion) can be applied here.
4. **Storage:** The processed record is written to the BigQuery table. Optionally, the raw message is archived to Cloud Storage for auditing and replay.
5. **Governance:** Cloud DLP inspection templates, Dataplex/Data Catalog metadata and retention policies support discovery, lineage and privacy controls.
6. **Monitoring:** Cloud Logging records processing status, errors and throughput metrics. Monitoring alert policies can be configured on failure rates or latency.

### Compliance Notes

* **Data minimisation:** Only required fields are persisted.  Identifiers are hashed to prevent re‑identification.
* **Retention:** BigQuery’s table partitioning and GCS lifecycle rules enforce automatic deletion of data after a defined period.
* **Security:** All data is encrypted at rest and in transit, with Cloud KMS customer-managed keys where configured. Service accounts are granted minimal roles (principle of least privilege). Secrets are not stored in code.
* **Transparency & accountability:** The README and this document describe data handling practices clearly.  Logging and audit trails support investigations or GDPR subject‑access requests.
